# node-express-site

A gorgeous portfolio site to showcase the projects I have built or worked on. The site has a landing page, an about page with contact info, and detail of 6 projects

A JSON file is used to store infrmation and all the data about the projects.

I used Pug to with provided templates that utilize the JSON to generate the markup that is ultimately displayed in the browser.
